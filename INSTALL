Installation of APAT is very straightforward, though you need
a number of other packages installed first which may not be
quite so simple! 


Installing GD
-------------
Download the following from http://www.boutell.com/gd/ (or more recent
versions): 
        gd-2.0.28.tar.gz


Unpack and install gd-2.0.28.tar.gz
       cd /tmp
       tar -zxvf gd-2.0.28.tar.gz
       cd gd-2.0.28
       ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apps/gd
       make
       make check
       su
       make install
       cd /usr/local/lib; ln -s ../apps/gd/lib/* .
       cd /usr/local/bin; ln -s ../apps/gd/bin/* .
       cd /usr/local/include; ln -s ../apps/gd/include/* .

(Note that I like to install packages under /usr/local/apps and then
provide links in /usr/local/bin, etc. You might want to skip this and
install directly in /usr/local/bin. In this case don't specify
--prefix and skip the last three lines where the links are created.) 

Installing Perl packages
------------------------
The following packages (and any dependent packages they need)
are required:

CGI.pm (should be installed on most systems already)
GD::Graph
XML::DOM
LWP

The following commands should do the trick:

perl -MCPAN -e shell
   install LWP
   install GD
   install GD::Graph
   install XML::DOM

Note that you should make sure you are running the version of Perl
which you want to use for APAT. (Some systems may have multiple
versions of Perl installed - make sure you use the full path to the
one you want).

Note that depending on the complexity of your local system
installation (e.g. multiple versions of libraries, Perl, etc) you may
have problems installing GD Perl support this way. If so, see the
notes below for some help.

Installing APAT
---------------
Simply run the install script in this directory (you may need to
change the first line if you do not have Perl in /usr/bin/perl). You
will be prompted for what you wish to install and which directories
you wish to install files in. You have complete control over where the
files are placed. 


======================================================================
Installing GD Perl support
==========================

If you have problems installing the Perl GD support using the
automated install with 'perl -MCPAN -e shell', you may have to do
it manually. Here are some notes from my own installation which
may help you.

Ensure that gdlib-config from what you have just installed comes up
first in your path - i.e. make sure /usr/local/bin is in the
path before anything else! Alternatively, hack Makefile.PL to make
sure it is running the right one.

Download the following from CPAN (or later versions)
--------------------------------
        GD-2.16.tar.gz
        GDGraph-1.43.tar.gz
        GDTextUtil-0.86.tar.gz
 

Unpack and install GD
---------------------
       cd /tmp
       tar -zxvf GD-2.16.tar.gz
       cd GD-2.16

       perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=site \
            INSTALLSITELIB=/usr/local/apps/perl5.8.3/lib/site_perl/5.8.3/ \
            INSTALLSITEARCH=/usr/local/apps/perl5.8.3/lib/site_perl/5.8.3/i686-linux/

(Note that you should make sure you are running the version of Perl
which you want to use for APAT. (Some systems may have multiple
versions of Perl installed - make sure you use the full path to the
one you want).
(This should report the correct GD library being used - if not, make
 sure the right gdlib-config is being used - see above).
(Make sure you specify the right directory for installing the modules
- depends on where your version of Perl lives)

       make
       make test
       make install


Unpack and install GD::Text
---------------------------
       cd /tmp
       tar -zxvf GDTextUtil-0.86.tar.gz
       cd GDTextUtil-0.86

       perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=site \
            INSTALLSITELIB=/usr/local/apps/perl5.8.3/lib/site_perl/5.8.3/ \
            INSTALLSITEARCH=/usr/local/apps/perl5.8.3/lib/site_perl/5.8.3/i686-linux/

(Note that you should make sure you are running the version of Perl
which you want to use for APAT. (Some systems may have multiple
versions of Perl installed - make sure you use the full path to the
one you want).
(Make sure you specify the right directory for installing the modules
- depends on where your version of Perl lives)

       make
       make test
       make install



Unpack and install GD::Graph
----------------------------
       cd /tmp
       tar -zxvf GDGraph-1.43.tar.gz
       cd GDGraph-1.43

       perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=site \
            INSTALLSITELIB=/usr/local/apps/perl5.8.3/lib/site_perl/5.8.3/ \
            INSTALLSITEARCH=/usr/local/apps/perl5.8.3/lib/site_perl/5.8.3/i686-linux/
(Note that you should make sure you are running the version of Perl
which you want to use for APAT. (Some systems may have multiple
versions of Perl installed - make sure you use the full path to the
one you want).
(make sure you specify the right directory for installing the modules

       make
       make test
       make samples
       xv samples/*.gif
       make install
